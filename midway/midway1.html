        If I had an ayausca trip so deep,<br>
        I'd want to wake up in the netherworld...greeted by none other than Alexander McQueen.<br>
        He'd tell me the secret to cheat death with art.<br>
        He'd tell me all great things come from humble starts.<br>
        Remind me that the beginning's just the beginning and is always hard enough <br>Because the end's only sweeter if it starts out rough.<br>
        The middle is where the glory is, All fearsome and wild.<br>
        But fearsome is only fearsome when you're fame's golden child.<br>
        The stars once above come glittering below. The stars will turn out in fancy cars to greet you on Saville Row.<br>
        And if this story is a story once put to the test, Investors and buyers wouldn't settle for less.<br>
        "Adieu my dear one, my mermaid song has been sung. I saw a mermaid that beaconed, And told me death had now come.<br> 
        For in my mind's eye my time had now come.<br>
        But for you at this moment, your time's just begun....<br>
